Instructions:
The version of python is 3.6.0
In question 3, Change to the source code directory and run the codes with python3 q3.py or python q3.py 
We may need to reinstall the sklearn package if there is an import error with sklearn.model.selection:
pip install sklearn

The output for each run will give the method dealing with certain dataset (e.g. MyLogisticReg2 with Boston50) and a table with 7 columns (with labels of col0 through col6) which contain every cross-validation run in a total of 5 times (i.e. K=0, K=1, … K=4) followed with the mean and variance of these 5 runs.
The tables in the pdf are reorganized to be more readable. I only create a documented table and change the header to be K=0, K=1, … K=4 following with Mean and Std (i.e. Standard Deviation).

The arguments for different methods in both my_cross_val and my_train_test are the string of the method names (i.e. " MyFLDA2")
